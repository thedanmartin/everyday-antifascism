					<p class="para1text para1box"><span class="header">Depending on your choice of news sources,</span> antifascists, or “antifa” (or Antifa, Anti-fa, 
					even the needlessly acronymic ANTIFA) have been portrayed as violent, unhinged radicals, 
					hell-bent on destruction of the rights of others. Or, at the other end of the spectrum, as 
					a loose network of far-left activists taking action to defend their communities against 
					individuals and organizations who would do them great political and social harm.
					<br>
					<br>
					In practice the latter interpretation is closest to the truth, though violence has 
					certainly played a role in the history of antifascist activism. Struggles against 
					colonialism, resistance to the KKK, partisan groups during World War II, and the evolution of leftist actions 
					since then—all have incorporated violent activity to some degree or another.</p>

				<div class="section" para2">
				
					<p class="leftbox leftboxtext"><br><br>What isn’t as well-documented are the non-violent activites of these activists.</p>
				
					<p class="rightbox rightboxtext"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Not everyone can or wants to physically engage with their political opposites, nor is such 
					engagement necessarily a winning strategy. Historically, conservative and far-right 
					entities have held a monopoly on violence due to a variety of factors. Standing up to 
					their oppressive politics requires careful research, clear communication, social exposure, 
					solid support, and comprehensive education. These are elements that historian and author 
					Mark Bray describes as “Everyday Antifascism” in his book <em>Antifa: The Anti Fascist Handbook</em>.
					<br>
					<br>
					These non-violent tactics are the focus of this web site. The site is not to be considered 
					as the end-all of antifascist activism, more a brief summation of tactics and the 
					start of a counter-narrative against the notion that activists of this nature are violent 
					and unhinged, but instead everyday people working to defend themselves and their communities 
					against political and social oppression.</p>

					<div class= "bookboxtext">This site leans heavily on Mark Bray’s book for both inspiration and content, especially 
					its Chapter Six, “Strategy, (Non)Violence, and Everyday Antifascism”.

					The book can be found via its publisher, <a href="https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/antifa/">Melville House</a>.

					providing context for this vital movement.
