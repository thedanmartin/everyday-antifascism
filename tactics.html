				<div class="section tactics-intro">
				<div class="tactics-text">A diversity of tactics is key to opposing far-right oppression. For those unwilling or 
				unable to directly confront fascist action in person, there are still a variety of steps 
				to take that can have a positive effect towards defending communities and targeted groups 
				of people.</div>
				</div>

				

				<div class="section research">
				<div class="tactics-header">Research</div>
				<div class="research-text">
				Fascism is not an ideology that suddenly springs fully-formed upon the scene, but is 
				slowly and carefully cultivated over time. Political pundits might scoff at the notion 
				that nascent far-right movements could have any effect on larger politics, but the evidence 
				is there that politicians will seize upon fascistic policies as a means to remain in power. 
				So become familiar with far-right groups operating in your town and their connections to 
				larger organizations nationwide. Pay attention to the speeches and press releases given 
				by the politicians they support. Learn about them online, in person, or via 
				infiltration—just be careful!
				</div>
				</div>

				

				<div class="section communicate">
				<div class="tactics-header">Communicate</div>
				<div class="communicate-text">
				Chances are there are people in your community that are as alarmed and frightened by 
				far-right politics as you are, or perhaps even more. Therefore, it’s essential to get the 
				word out that they are not alone and to warn others of the potentially dangerous nature of 
				far-right influence. Producing communicative materials like flyers, stickers, leaflets, 
				banners, videos, songs, art, and books is an effective way to build networks and help 
				bolster mutual support for one another. Clear communication will help your friends and 
				neighbors find common ground and stand up for one another.
				</div>
				</div>

				

				<div class="section dox">
				<div class="tactics-header">Dox</div>
				<div class="dox-text">
				Some say “sunshine is the best disinfectant”, and this tactic exemplifies that notion. 
				Many far-right activists and sympathizers who hold oppressive, repugnant, and even violent 
				beliefs don’t want those beliefs being widely known. Therefore, it’s important to make 
				those private views public and connect them explicitly with individuals who hold them. 
				This can include notifying their employers, teachers, neighbors, and wider communities 
				about what is brewing in their midst. The goal is to expose far-right activists and 
				organizers until they are disowned, fired, ostracized, and shut down—to make the social 
				costs of organizing around such views so high that there is no choice but to quit.
				</div>
				</div>

				

				<div class="section support">
				<div class="tactics-header">Support</div>
				<div class="support-text">
				The typical targets of far-right politics include marginalized groups. These can be 
				immigrants, the poor, women (especially in the realm of reproductive rights), and more. 
				Show your support for these groups by working with them to help achieve their goals and 
				defend their rights. Oppose police brutality in all its forms. Building community and 
				solidarity with people who are targeted by far-right activists and organizers strengthens 
				and protects everyone involved.
				</div>
				</div>

				

				<div class="section educate">
				<div class="tactics-header">Educate</div>
				<div class="educate-text">
				Vigilance against far-right oppression requires continuous self-improvement and education. 
				Organizing reading groups, concerts, shows, art exhibitions, political training, athletics, 
				fundraising, and other events to help educate your community will bring people together 
				and make them smarter about working together to defend themselves. One of the primary 
				tactics of far-right activism is disinformation—only a well-educated, critical opposition 
				can recognize their deception and successfully counter its influence. Sharing ideas and 
				sharpening intellectual acuity will help you and your community a great deal in the 
				struggle against violence and oppression.
